    <h2>why am i doing a computer cience graduation ? :</h2>
      <p>Since i was little,i been in love for cience and pela technology , for what makes the humankind even wiser .</p>

      <p>So, i came to to cesar school know more about this thing called computer cience</p>
<h2>my skills</h2>
      <p>ever since I was little I liked to write and read about different subjects , in my text for the test of the brasilian federal exam ( ENEM ) i won´t let my text have the same estructure , every time i wrote i liked to create something new .</p>
      <p>I may not know how to do something especific , but i do my best to figure out , just like i did when i created this website and created my project from the project 1 discipline </p>
      <p>In the very start of this year i did an exchange program to montreal ,it Was a great opportunity to boost my english habilities . Howerver since it was over, i continue to study a foreing languagen , reading books ou watching youtube videos .  
      <p>i am very into having ideias , thinking in solutions for problems , finding better alternatives , the job that i must take as my own, in my point of view  , must be something just like that</p>
      <h2>Plans for my future </h2>
